            <h2>About Horsefighter: The Game That Needs No Introduction (But We'll Give It One Anyway)</h2>\
            <p>For too long, the fighting game genre has been dominated by mere humans, robots, and... well, more humans. But what if we told you there was a deeper, more primal form of combat? A form where every neigh is a battle cry and every kick is a thunderous blow?</p>\
            <p>Enter <strong>Horsefighter</strong>. This isn't just a game; it's a movement. We're talking hyper-realistic equine physics, groundbreaking "Mane Mane Martial Arts" combat styles, and a roster of majestic, hoof-wielding warriors ready to gallop their way into your hearts (and onto your screens).</p>\
            <h3>Key "Features" (We Think They're Features)</h3>\
            <ul>\
                <li><strong>Unbridled Combat:</strong> Experience 8 unique horse combatants, from "Stallion Stallone" to "Mare-y Poppins of Pain."</li>\
                <li><strong>Dynamic Destructible Environments:</strong> Watch as arenas are literally trampled into dust!</li>\
                <li><strong>Whinnying Voice Acting:</strong> Each horse has a full range of emotional whinnies, snorts, and aggressive neighs.</li>\
                <li><strong>"Hay Bale" Health System:</strong> Collect hay bales mid-fight to regain your stamina (and dignity).</li>\
                <li><strong>Procedurally Generated Horse Hair Textures:</strong> No two mane flows are ever the same!</li>\
            </ul>\

            <h2>Why Your Generous Contribution is Absolutely Crucial (No Pressure)</h2>\
            <p>Developing a game of this unprecedented equine magnitude is no small feat. We've poured our souls (and limited hay reserves) into the pre-alpha, but to truly unleash the majestic fury of Horsefighter, we need YOU! Your pledges will directly fund:</p>\
            <ul>\
                <li><strong>More Neighs:</strong> Deeper, richer, more impactful whinnies.</li>\
                <li><strong>Anti-Gravity Horseshoes:</strong> To prevent excessive ground clipping (a common issue in equine combat simulations).</li>\
                <li><strong>Carrot-Based Microtransactions:</strong> (Just kidding! ...Mostly.)</li>\
                <li><strong>Our developers' caffeine addiction:</strong> Essential for 24/7 horse research.</li>\

            <p>Developing a game of this magnitude isn't without its hurdles. Here are a few we might, or might not, encounter:</p>\
            <ul>\
                <li><strong>Horse-related Injuries:</strong> Our motion-capture horses might get diva attitudes.</li>\
                <li><strong>Unforeseen Whinnying Costs:</strong> Professional voice actors for horses are surprisingly expensive.</li>\
                <li><strong>Temporal Anomalies:</strong> The game might accidentally send players back in time to the Pliocene epoch. (Unlikely, but not impossible.)</li>\
                <li><strong>Creative Differences:</strong> Gareth wants a "Horse Riding a Horse" character. Barnaby says "No."</li>\
                <li><strong>Global Hay Shortage:</strong> Our primary energy source for development.</li>\
            </ul>\
            <p class="disclaimer">Rest assured, we are 100% committed to delivering Horsefighter, even if it means selling our own prized ponies. (Again, mostly kidding.)</p>\
